PoolCommand is an android app that serves as a remote user interface for a custom swimming pool automation controller. 
Initially it's focused on regulating chlorine levels by dispensing sodium hypochlorite. Eventually it will also manage 
lighting, solar heating, cleaning and whatever else. Connection to the controller is Bluetooth. 

The automation controller is based on an mbed microcontroller. The controller code is maintained in an mbed repository
